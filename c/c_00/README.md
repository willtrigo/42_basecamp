# C 00 - Basecamp

This exercise list is where C begins in C Basecamp.

C is considered a fundamental programming language, widely known for its simplicity and close-to-hardware nature. By teaching C, 42 aims to provide a solid foundation in programming concepts and low-level operations. C requires students to have a good understanding of programming concepts and forces them to be meticulous in their code writing. By teaching C as the main language, 42 emphasizes the importance of strong foundations, which can be transferred to other programming languages.

Here is are some of the topics covered in C 00:

## Basic Syntax and Variables

- Introduction to the C programming language.
- Understanding the structure of a C program.
- Declaring and using variables.
- Working with different data types (e.g., integers, characters, etc).
- Basic arithmetic operations and expressions.

## Control Flow and Loops

- Conditional statements (if-else) for decision-making.
- Looping structures (while loops) for repetitive tasks.
- Nested loops and multi-level control flow.

## Functions and Modular Programming:

- Introduction to functions and their purpose.
- Function declaration, definition, and invocation.
- Passing arguments to functions.
- Returning values from functions.
- Using libraries and pre-defined functions.
- Modular programming concepts and organizing code.
