# Rush 00 - Basecamp

Rush 00 is an intensive project designed to test and refine the programming skills of aspiring developers during their first weeks at 42 school's Piscine. This project delves into the fundamentals of C programming, pushing participants to tackle tasks like:

- Mastering file I/O: Reading and writing data from files efficiently.
- Conquering algorithms: Implementing algorithms like the infamous "find the biggest square" challenge (BSQ).
- Harnessing data structures: Utilizing arrays and pointers to manipulate data effectively.
- Embracing C syntax: Grasping essential C syntax elements like loops, conditionals, and functions.

Rush 00 is more than just a project, it's a baptism by fire for aspiring programmers. It's a chance to learn, adapt, and push your limits in a supportive and collaborative environment. Completing Rush 00 is a badge of honor, signifying your commitment to the rigorous path of becoming a 42-trained developer.
